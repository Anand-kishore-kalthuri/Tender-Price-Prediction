__Railway Tender Price Prediction Project Explanation__
This project involves building a machine learning-based application to predict railway tender
prices (L1 Price) based on input features such as Railway Location, Nature of Work, Category, 
Basic Cost, and Quantity. Below is a detailed explanation of each phase of the project, with 
a strong focus on Data Analysis, EDA, and Data Cleaning.


1. Problem Statement
Railway tenders often involve competitive bidding, and accurate price prediction is crucial to
ensure efficient decision-making for bidders.


The goal is to:

Predict the L1 Price using machine learning models.


Derive actionable insights from the data to understand price variations and influencing factors.


2. Data Collection
Data for this project was extracted from a structured MySQL database. The dataset contained information about:


Railway locations.

Types of work (Nature).

Material categories.

Basic costs.

Quantities of work.


3. Data Understanding
The raw dataset was loaded into Python for analysis using Pandas. The dataset had the following attributes:

Railway_Location: Names of various railway zones (e.g., BHOPAL, CHENNAI).

Nature: Type of work involved (e.g., Supply, Execution, Supervision).

Category: Material or work category (e.g., 60 Kg, R260 CMD).

Basic: Base price of the material.

Qty: Quantity required for the work.

L1_Price: Target variable indicating the awarded tender price.


4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted in two parts:

A. Categorical Feature Analysis
Railway_Location:

Total unique railway locations: X (e.g., BHOPAL, CHENNAI).


Top 5 locations by tender frequency:
BHOPAL: 15%
CHENNAI: 12%
MUMBAI: 10%

Insight: Certain railway zones dominate tender issuance.


Nature:

Distribution:

Supply: 40%

Execution: 35%

Supervision: 20%

Equipment: 5%

Insight: Most tenders are either for supply or execution.
Category:

Most common categories:

60 Kg: 50%

R260 CMD: 30%

Rare categories: HH 1080.

Insight: Standardized materials dominate tenders.


B. Numerical Feature Analysis
Basic:

Mean: ₹11,000.
Median: ₹10,050.
Range: ₹1000 to ₹Y100000.
Skewness: Slightly positive, indicating some high-value tenders.

Insight: Basic cost is concentrated between ₹X,000–₹Y,000, with outliers for high-value projects.

Qty:

Mean: 856 units.
Range: 10 to 5,000 units.
Skewness: Positive, with some extremely high-quantity tenders.
Insight: Tenders for large-scale projects are infrequent but significant.


L1_Price:

Mean: ₹150,000.
Median: ₹130,000.
Range: ₹5,000 to ₹1,00,00,000.
Insight: L1 prices are correlated with basic costs and quantity.


C. Insights Using Visualizations
Pie Chart:

Showed distribution of railway locations.

Highlighted that BHOPAL, CHENNAI, and MUMBAI dominate tender allocation.

Bar Plots:

Analyzed tender count across categories.


Identified 60 Kg as the most frequent category.


Scatter Plots:

Explored relationships between Basic and L1_Price.

Showed a linear correlation between base price and tender price.


Box Plots:

Used to detect outliers in Basic and Qty.


5. Data Cleaning

Key steps in cleaning:

Handling Missing Values:

Missing values in Railway_Location and Nature replaced with "Unknown".

Median imputation applied for missing Basic values.


Outlier Treatment:

Applied IQR method to cap extreme values in Basic and Qty.


Encoding Categorical Variables:

Used OneHotEncoding for Railway_Location, Nature, and Category.


Normalization:

Scaled numerical fields (Basic, Qty) using StandardScaler.


Feature Engineering:

Created an interaction term: Cost_per_Unit = Basic / Qty.


6. Model Development


Pipeline:
A preprocessing pipeline was created using Pipeline from Scikit-learn:

Step 1: Impute missing values.
Step 2: Scale numerical features.
Step 3: Encode categorical features.


Trained Models:
Linear Regression:

Selected for its simplicity and interpretability.
R² Score: 0.9715.
MSE: 23973690.123405002
Decision Tree Regressor:

Captured non-linear relationships.
R² Score: 0.87.
MSE: 5441.16551.
Random Forest Regressor:

R² Score: 0.90.
MSE: 46526.6516.


7. Deployment
The final Linear Regression model was exported as pipeline_with_model.pkl and integrated into a Streamlit app for user interaction.

8. Key Insights

Railway Locations Influence:

  Tenders are concentrated in a few railway zones, such as BHOPAL and CHENNAI.


Nature of Work:

  Supply and Execution dominate, suggesting material procurement and execution are core tender activities.


Price Drivers:

  Basic and Qty strongly influence L1_Price.

  Categories like 60 Kg have predictable price ranges.


Data Skewness:

  A few high-value tenders significantly skew Basic and L1_Price, reflecting large-scale projects.
