__ðŸš† Railway Tender Price Prediction Application__
This repository contains a Railway Tender Price Prediction Application, designed to predict
the L1 Price based on key features using machine learning models such as Linear Regression
and Decision Tree Regression. The project leverages Python, Streamlit, SQL, and several data
preprocessing and analysis libraries. The application includes a user-friendly web interface 
built with Streamlit.
